# World_Weather_Analysis

In this challenge, we have added the weather description to the weather data we had already retrieved during the module. Beta testers will be able to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, beta testers will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary and, using the Google Maps Directions API, we can create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
